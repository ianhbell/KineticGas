## Dependencies

The Python package dependencies are listed in the `setup.py` file in the root directory of the package.

To compile the binary that is called from the python wrapper, [pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is required.

A standalone C++ module, that works without the python wrapper is currently under development. See branches under `pure_cpp/` for the most up-to-date version there.
